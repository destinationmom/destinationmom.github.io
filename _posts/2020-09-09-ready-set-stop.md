In late July 2020, we decided we were ready to have a child of our own. We (mostly he at first) did research into what it would take for us to make it happen.

As of July, I'd been transitioning for more than 5 years. I'd been doing HRT for about the same amount of time. When I started, my doctor did ask about "preserving" something in case I wanted kids. But that was 2015. My head was in a completely different place. I just wanted a relief from the dysphoria and to put the brakes on the descent I'd been on for years.

I actually think this is kind of a difficult spot for both doctors and trans patients. Having children of my own seemed like a luxury that I could not afford (financially, mentally, physically, etc, etc). Having not yet begun HRT at that time, I could scarcely imagine living past 30 anyway. Not to mention, preserving material is expensive. At the time I was still in a crappy job. Another luxury I could not afford.

That was 5 years ago.

Since then, I met my fiance. We've moved in together. I changed jobs _twice_. I'm just now, finally as of July 2019 being paid what I'm worth. (It only took 9 damn years out of college...hang in there, kids.) So as much as I don't want to be "that asshole" that changes her mind and gives cause for doctors everywhere to endlessly parrot, "see, I told you so...", hopefully you can see that the situation wasn't black and white. Life never is.

But ultimately, I think it's ok. We all make decisions, and we deal with the results of those decisions. Hell that's pretty much my entire job. We now made the decision to try to have kids of our own. What were the next steps though?

His doctor referred us to a reproductive medicine clinic with her endorsement that "they're good with trans couples, they'll be able to help you figure stuff out." Unfortunately in this instance "trans couples" apparently meant trans men and their cis female partners exclusively. Great. They were able to clearly lay out a path for things my fiance would need to do, but me? Well, they'd never had a trans woman before. They had no idea. Should I stop hormones? Maybe. Anything else? Well, they didn't know. Ugh, fantastic. Even going back to my doctor, who specializes in trans healthcare. Should I do this? Should I do that? "I don't know. Maybe. Maybe not."

That has been one of the hardest parts of this so far: feeling like a freak. I guess trans women don't ever want to or try to have kids, if all of these medical professionals have never even encountered one trying before. As personally satisfying as it might be to blame all of them, it's hardly their fault exclusively. Do your own internet searches. You'll find the same proverbial _shrug_ in the tiny amount of information that does turn up. So I guess no one knows. That's been an incredibly demoralizing part of this process for me. My friend says that just means I'm a pioneer, but it's hard not to feel like a freak.

Well, something certainly had to be done. I know my body pretty well, and I was fairly certain that while hormones were helping me tremendously, they were going to be quite the showstopper for this endeavor. So on August 15, 2020 almost exactly 5 years to the day of starting HRT, I stopped.
