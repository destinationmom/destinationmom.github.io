title: Slowly, Then Suddenly
---

I feel like lots of things in life follow the pattern of "slowly, then suddenly." Since at least early September, we've both been in kind of a holding pattern. I needed to wait until my hormone levels shifted and I was able to produce viable stuff (whether or not this would occur at all was unknown) and he needed to wait until his hormone levels shifted _and_ we got an actual ovulation cycle. We both got tests done to see the status of things. I fortunately was ok, and he was too, but without a cycle, we were kind of stuck.

So we had a hysterosonogram. This finally confirmed once and for all that not only things were good, but things were _happening_ too. Possibly on their own, but even if not, we could use a medication to give things a boost. Today we got confirmation that things were happening on their own, so no medication would be required. In fact, it's looking like this week is our first shot. So just like _that_ we're in it. We had debated even using IUI if everything was good and no other barriers to natural contraception were present, but given where we're at (ok, mostly me) we decided to at least go that route this first time.

So yeah...me. How has this been? It's been...not great, if I'm honest. I've _never_ liked having sexual intercourse and early in this process, we both questioned whether or not I'd even be able to "take things to completion" as it were. It took a while, but I guess I eventually got over it. I still hate it, and I feel like total trash before, during and afterward, but I remind myself over and over that it's for something important. I can't explain it, but going the IUI route seems to somehow feel marginally better. Maybe it's because it's pulling me one step away from everything. I'm not really sure.

Something I didn't expect is feeling like a tertiary party in all this. I understand that physically speaking, I'm not carrying the baby, and I feel that pain every single day. But it's the culmination of all the factors surrounding it. I can't physically carry the baby. I can't just have sex and get pregnant. I can't even remotely enjoy the sex involved to get to that point. I feel all of this so poignantly that it's hard sometimes to interpret benign things objectively. Even small things feel like an attack of who I am. The passing word "guest" when referring to me when discussing one of my fiance's doctor's appointments sent me into a spiral. I know a lot of that is on me, to re-interpret and step back, but it's really hard.

There's a lot of information out there about trans men getting pregnant and their experiences. I think that's good. There seems to be voices out there trying to make things better. Telling people how to better use language to be more inclusive (or at least less awkward) in those situations. I can't really argue with that. I just really wish there was the same thing for trans women. I wish there was more sensible advice for doctors working with us and understanding of our needs and feelings.

For me, I really wish there was more understanding of the tremendous dysphoria element this entire process brings. I very much understand that for many things, there's no alternative. Semen samples are best gathered one way. But like, if there could just be some kind of acknowledgement of that struggle. Something. I don't know. As I said, from my point of view, I'm off hormones, in a body that's once again feeling like not my own. Taking part in a process that my entire soul is screaming that I'm supposed to be doing myself. I feel disconnected and numb to everything. The biggest thing that would help me is just helping me to feel included in the process in all ways. I feel like the problem is that a lot of men don't want to be that included, or even need to be. But I'm not a man. That doesn't work for me. I _need_ to be included in every aspect possible (barring physical impossibility of course). Shit, I'm still grappling with the fact that I will not be getting pregnant myself. I feel like I'm trying to land an airplane blindfolded while someone talks me through it.

So please, doctors, medical professionals...I know I'm blind here. Don't leave me hanging trying to land the plane by myself. Include me in what's going on.
