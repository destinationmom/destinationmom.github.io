I've had a _very_ rough few days personally. Partially related to slow (read: nonexistent) return on important test results from the reproductive clinic. More on _that_ in a bit. Partially related to just dealing with the results of coming off hormones. I guess I didn't really consider the breadth of impact it would have. There are the physical aspects of it but there are also considerable mental aspects, too.

I've struggled trying to figure out exactly how to put the feeling. I bounced around. At first I thought, "ugh, it's literally like being sent **back** through puberty again." But that alone doesn't quite cover it. No, it's deeper than that. That might be the best way to describe it physically, but mentally there's more to it. I struggled and struggled. It's like, I don't feel like a woman maybe? Yes, but it's so much deeper than that: I don't feel like myself.

Everything feels different now. Feeling horny feels different. Sex feels different. Worse than different. It feels like it's not me. I feel like I'm feeling someone else's feelings. Of course, _on_ hormones, it's a different story. I feel comfortable. I feel connected. Genitals and various physical features aside, my body, and more importantly my mind, feels like me.

Most days lately, I genuinely don't know if I'm strong enough to keep doing this. I think, maybe there would be a better time where I'd be more grounded. But I don't think there's ever a time when anyone is grounded enough to sail through something like this. I've certainly read anecdotes here and there of trans women who _have_ just stopped. They couldn't keep doing it. My heart breaks hearing that. God only knows how hard they tried to hold on before throwing in the towel. Will I be able to hold on?

The following is something I've never really shared with anybody because I'm ashamed. I imagine I get up in the mornings like most people. Unlike most people though, I can immediately feel my body. I can feel where everything is. What's there, what isn't. And I feel like I've woke up to some insane reality in which I wasn't born female. Different days come with varying levels of disbelief, but the disbelief is there. This _overwhelming_ sadness of "holy shit...wtf is going on?! This can't be real. This can't be real." I have that feeling every morning, and I get up. I get dressed. I make my coffee, and I go to work like any other responsible adult human. I've got bills to pay and responsibilities after all.
