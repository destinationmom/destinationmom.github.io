Because there's such a lack of information (both online and from my IRL doctor) about what I should do regarding HRT, I basically had to make my own assessment and decision.

## _DISCLAIMER_
***I'm not a doctor. I don't even play one on TV. Nothing I say should be interpreted as anything other than _my personal experience and thoughts_. It's not medical advice and _should not_ be treated as such.***

I don't know if it's still common or not, but one of the oft-repeated phrases I heard when I was starting to transition was YMMV (your mileage may vary). I think that's very much the best assessment of the situation here as well. I wish I could just tell you "it'll take x months of being off HRT". It just doesn't work that way. In my humble opinion medical doctors, via tests and a doctor-patient relationship, _should_ be able to offer a better assessment for you, but as my experience has shown, even that's not the case.

For better or worse, I know my body. I knew that things _probably_ weren't producing the "stuff" I would need for this in any significant quantity or quality. That's why I chose to stop HRT. Some people out there (including my doctor) suggested a tapering, but I'm not sure of the logic of that. I didn't, and it seemed to work out ok for me.

So after 5 years of being on the correct hormones, how did coming off of them feel? I won't sugar-coat it: it's fucking awful. Not right away. It took me about 2-3 weeks before I really started to notice, but I definitely did. If you've been on HRT, you know that different things happen at different speeds. Some things happen quickly, other things take longer. Coming off seems to be about the same, but in reverse. Sadly, one of the first things I noticed was the un-atrophy-ing of stuff between my legs. Without a doubt, this has been the worst thing so far. I've had a hard time with that area of my body for most of my life, and it's only been through happenstance that everything there is still intact now. I really hate it. I feel awful. If the promise of a child wasn't at the end of this I would 1000% not do it.
