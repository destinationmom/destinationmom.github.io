I created this blog to document my journey to becoming a mom, unconventional as it may be. I'm a transgender woman. When looking into information about what to do, my fiance and I found little information about trans women. Should I do this? Should I do that? Nobody seems to know. Even my doctor who specializes in transgender care doesn't seem to really know.

It's pretty disheartening to feel even more like a weirdo in this situation, so I'm hoping that at least by documenting what I'm going through, others might not have to feel so alone.
